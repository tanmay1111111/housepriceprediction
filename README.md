I am excited to share my latest project where I developed a robust algorithm for predicting house prices based on various key features.

In this project, I performed extensive preprocessing and data handling to ensure high-quality input. I collected data on several features, including the average number of rooms, per capita crime rate by town, and land zone for square footage, among others. By leveraging powerful techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, I built a highly accurate predictive model that achieves an impressive 88% accuracy.

To gain a deeper understanding of the data and model performance, I employed advanced techniques such as cross-validation. This allowed me to measure precision, recall, and F1 score, enabling comprehensive evaluation and fine-tuning of the model. I visualized these metrics using matplotlib to create informative graphs, including a heatmap, which provides a clear overview of the model's performance across different features.

Deploying the model was a crucial step in this project, as it enables seamless and efficient prediction of house prices. By utilizing the developed algorithm, users can input various features and obtain accurate price predictions, empowering individuals, real estate professionals.
